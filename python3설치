Installing Python 3.7.4 on Raspbian

1.Install the required build-tools (some might already be installed on your system).

apt-get update -y
apt-get install build-essential tk-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline6-dev libdb5.3-dev libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev -y

2.Download and install Python 3.7.4. When downloading the source code, select the most recent release of Python, available on the official site. Adjust the file names accordingly.

wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/Python-3.7.4.tar.xz
tar xf Python-3.7.4.tar.xz
cd Python-3.7.4
./configure
make -j 4
sudo make altinstall

#Optionally: Delete the source code and uninstall the previously installed packages. When uninstalling the packages, make sure you only remove those that were not previously installed on your system. Also, remember to adjust version numbers if necesarry.

sudo rm -r Python-3.7.4
rm Python-3.7.4.tar.xz
sudo apt-get --purge remove build-essential tk-dev -y
sudo apt-get --purge remove libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline6-dev -y
sudo apt-get --purge remove libdb5.3-dev libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev -y
sudo apt-get --purge remove libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev -y
sudo apt-get autoremove -y
sudo apt-get clean

or simply copy the setup.sh content to a file called setup.sh, do a chmod +x setup.sh and execute the script via sudo ./setup.sh

Afterwards, execute any of your scripts (yourscript.py is just a placeholder) using

python3.7 yourscript.py.
